Alpha Setback will consist of a single round with a single trick.
The player hands will each consist of one card, that they will play in the round.
Trump will always be Spades, but most trump rules won't need to be implemented.
The trick will go as follows:
	Player One plays the Ace of Spades, 
	Player Two plays the Two of Spades, 
	Player Three plays the Jack of Spades,
	Player Four plays the Ten of Spades.
This trick will produce a TrickResult.  That TrickResult will be the only result in the RoundResult.

This version will require basic implementation of playCard, playTrick, and playRound,
and support for a Hand.
