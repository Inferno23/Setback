Gamma Setback will consist of a single round with four tricks.
The player hands will each consist of four cards, that can be played in various orders, but must follow suit rules.
These hands are the same as in Beta.
The new factor in this version is the BetController, which handles betting by the players.
This means certain things will need to be implemented:
	- Betting
	- Picking Trump
	- Correct person leading first trick
	- Check if a team met its goal for the round, this will help with persistent scoring.
